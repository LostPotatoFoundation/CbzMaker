# CbzMaker
VBS Script to make CBZs

Used to zip folders full of images into a zip using 7Zip then renames to .cbz
Renames all CB* files getting rid of tags such as [english][RandomUploader][potatoevent](C98) etc...
I made this because all my cbzs for my bleach manga said
[Bleach][English][Scanlations]bleach_ch396_pgs0-29[fixed].cbz
now it's bleach_ch396_pgs0-29.cbz
